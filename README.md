# Web-Clone
- This is a Project created to clone websites that I came across to pursuit web-development

## 1st Webpage: [Minh xin ch√†o](https://minhxinchao.com/optin-page-da-biet-ve-freelance?gad_source=2&gad_campaignid=22335961377&wbraid=ClkKCAjwss3DBhBFEkkAkIzbRKPBL1iTgP_imWoZNl5Jut8PB9sCGb6nu2sLeNlDi-HUACJI0rNpXqg7iyCUlm5FG_0tQG1fWuP-71Oe4btOcLXs6_-VGgInIQ)
- I saw this webpage in an ad and though it was easy to remake so I jumped right into creating this project and cloning the first website.

## 2nd Webpage: [To-do List](./Webpages/To-Do%20List/)
- This is a Lab in my freeCodeCamp Web-development Curriculumn
